# Drum-Kit

This is a fun project i made wherin the user can press the displayed alphabets on the keyboard and the mentioned sound below that aplhabet will be played. It also makes a cool beat transition effect when pressing the key. 

I have used 2 main EvenetLsiterners 'keydown' that listens for any key pressed on the Keyboard and 'transitionend' that is used to achieve the beat effect.

This can be used a fun time pass website. So hope you all enjoy using the website and please provide your valueable feedabck.

Happpy Playing!!!!!!
